Medication History Tracker - Documentation


Medication History Tracker Overview:

The Medication History Tracker is a program that takes in a User’s name and their medication information and outputs a functional tracker that tracks their progress, 
checks interactions between medications, sends reminders, and outputs a journal of medications when they’re taken.

How to Run the Program:

The program can be run by opening the repository on Visual Code Studios. From there, you must access the main.py file of the repository and open the Terminal. On the terminal, 
type in “python” if using a Windows device, or “python3” if using Mac, followed by “main.py”.

How to Interpret the Results:

The output contains text results from each class that results from the input data in the main.py file. It starts off by identifying for which user the health journal is meant 
for and contains the possible interactions/side effects between the medications, progress showing if a medication is taken or not and when the next time and date the medication should be taken, 
and a confirmation of reminders sent for the user to take the medications at those times. A question pops up at the end asking if the user would like a text output of their medications, 
if “yes” is typed, a confirmation text appears and “medication_journal.txt” appears in the repository.

This source was used to find the interactions between common prescribed, and over-the-counter drugs. These interactions were listed in the interactions_db of our code, and were responsible for checking 
potential interactions between a user’s medications in their current medication list. These interactions are listed to be major, moderate, or minor, and each has a descriptive note of the interaction’s 
process of what it does.
